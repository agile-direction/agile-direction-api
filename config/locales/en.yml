        We're talking about major things here.
        Missions are not things that you can do, they're a theme that guides what you will do.
        Be the queen of vague here, like "be a better person" because, realistically, this is just a categorization.
        In terms of James Bond, a Mission would be something like "Skyfall."
        Also, to be honest, "Skyfall" is a pretty sweet name -- if you've having trouble coming up with one, just use that.

        what are some things that will add valuable impact in accomplishing that?

        What's going to make a difference?
        More often than not, these will be money-makers and prioritization will be based on how much money each will make.
        For other types of lists, these will represent something like happiness, and prioritization will be based upon which will make you happier quicker.
        Going back to that James Bond metaphor of Skyfall, deliverables would look something like this.
      example_1:
        title: Be quicker than scorpians
        value: "Value: I don't die"
      example_2:
        title: Get stronger so I can be licensed
        value: "Value: Do awesome shit"
      example_3:
        title: Defeat Javier Bardem
        value: "Value: Civilization doesn't collapse"

      title: Speak
      mission:
        name: Missions
        speak:
          An accomplishment requiring a plan of attack.
          Typically, these are themes, ideas or team objectives, in a broader sense.
          Essentially, Missions are any categorization of work.
      deliverable:
        name: Deliverables
        speak:
          Anything that provides clear value to a Mission.
          Deliverables are not tasks that represent work -- these are purely value propositions.
          If you're planning on going to the moon, deliverables may be something like this.
        example_1:
          title: Get a Spacecraft into Orbit
          value: "Value: We can propel things into space"
        example_2:
          title: Spacewalk
          value: "Value: Demonstrate that people can be in space without dying"
        example_3:
          title: Land on the Moon
          value: "Value: Inspire Michael Jackson to create the Moonwalk"
