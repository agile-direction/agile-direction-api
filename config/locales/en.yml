        Missions are not things that you can do, they're a theme that guides what you will do.
        In terms of James Bond, a Mission would be something like "Skyfall."
        Also, to be honest, "Skyfall" is a pretty sweet name -- if you've having trouble coming up with one, just use that.

        What's going to make a difference?
        Each deliverable should provide meaningful value towards a goal.
        Depending on the type of mission you're on, value could be money, time, happiness or something else.
        If you're planning on going to the moon, deliverables may be something like this.

      mission:
        name: Missions
        speak:
          An accomplishment requiring a plan of attack.
          Typically, these are themes, ideas or team objectives, in a broader sense.
          Essentially, Missions are any categorization of work.
      deliverable:
        name: Deliverables
        speak:
          Anything that provides clear value to a Mission.
          Deliverables are not tasks that represent work -- these are purely value propositions.
          If you're planning on going to the moon, deliverables may be something like this.
        example_1:
          title: Get a Spacecraft into Orbit
          value: "Value: Proof that we can get things into space"
        example_2:
          title: Spacewalk
          value: "Value: Demonstrate that people can be in space without dying"
        example_3:
          title: Land on the Moon
          value: "Value: Inspire Michael Jackson to create the Moonwalk"
